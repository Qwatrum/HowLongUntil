## Usage:
* Visit the website [here](https://qwatrum.github.io/HowLongUntil/ "https://qwatrum.github.io/HowLongUntil/")
* Or clone the repo and host it

## Add your own events:
* In `script.js` look for `const targetEvents = [...];` (line 6)
* There you can add your own events
* The order doesn't matter
* Follow this pattern:
    * Name. Date.
    * The date must look like: `2025-01-01T00:00:00`
    * (Year - Month - Day - 'T' - HH - MM - SS)
    * Example: `{ name: "New Year ðŸŽ†", dateTime: '2025-01-01T00:00:00'}`
* Simply reload the website
